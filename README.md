## Developing Predictive Models for Diagnosing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

### Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age worldwide. PCOS is characterized by a large spectrum of symptoms including irregular menstrual cycles, polycystic ovaries, and high levels of male hormones leading to challenges for fertility and also overall wellbeing for women by increasing risks of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cardiovascular issues and more. 
In spite of PCOS being the most common endocrinopathy affecting 8% to 13% of reproductive aged women (Joham et al., 2022), the primary challenge in managing PCOS lies in its diagnosis and identifying the risk factors due to its heterogeneous nature and the overlap of its symptoms with other health conditions mentioned above. 

Therefore, for our project, our primary objective is to develop concrete predictive models that can help researchers and healthcare professionals to diagnose PCOS and predict its risk factors. 

### Motivation

Our motivation for selecting this topic stems from the increasing prevalence of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) among women and its broad array of associated health conditions. We are intrigued by the increasing commonality of this syndrome and the profound impact it has on women's health. Considering the diverse range of conditions linked with PCOS and a lack of understanding of what may cause people to develop it, recognizing the syndrome can be a significant challenge for patients. 
We believe that this situation provides a unique opportunity to investigate the symptoms deeply, identify the root causes, and understand the factors contributing to its rising incidence. Moreover, we are planning to explore effective recovery methods and strategies for people to retrieve from PCOS. 

### Information about the Dataset 
In order to explore the complex interplay of factors contributing to PCOS, we are going to source a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle that includes the various causes and symptoms associated with PCOS (Bobby, 2022).

The dataset we chose encompasses data from 541 patients who were diagnosed with PCOS with 18 features, including demographic details such as age, weight, and height. Beyond these basic variables, it includes the medical history, BMI and physical characteristics of the patient, and most importantly records the results of an ultrasound examination which is commonly used to diagnose PCOS (Bobby, 2022). 
Given that the most common symptoms of PCOS often include obesity, excessive hair growth and acne (Joham et al., 2022), we believe that our dataset is adequate enough to analyze and quantify these manifestations. This selection ensures that our analysis is based on real-life data which would enable us to draw meaningful conclusions. By leveraging this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns of PCOS and develop robust models that can diagnose PCOS and predict its risk factors. 

### Goals and Objectives
The overarching goal of this project is to leverage data analytic techniques we have learnt so far to create predictive models to improve the diagnosis and understanding of PCOS. A predictive model can aid in understanding conditions and/or underlying factors that affect how likely a person is to develop PCOS and perhaps indicate certain factors that are currently being overlooked. 
Another objective of this project relating to predictive modeling is to be able to create ones that can reliably work on diverse populations that may not be included in the dataset. These generic models may be able to provide further insight into underlying factors than a model that is highly fitted to the dataset.
Utilizing the trends and patterns we notice throughout the project (whether that be through predictive modeling, cleaning up and understanding the data, or other means) can also allow us to raise awareness about PCOS. As we’ve mentioned, PCOS is a complex disorder, and along with physical symptoms, the psychological impacts it may have are not well understood and are often underestimated, even by those in the medical community (McCook et al., 2005). Through our work on this project, we hope to contribute a greater understanding of PCOS to a larger group of people, both in and outside of the medical community, such that those with this condition may feel better understood and receive better care.
